# GoldenEYE-Remote-Decoder
A template to used with LG's GoldenEYE infrared remote for multiple purposes. 

This script is moved from my archive private repos which I wrote more than 10 years ago. BTW, it might be beneficial to anyone who interest to work with this IR remote. Build and upload this code into your MCU eg Arduino, ESP, STM, etc, and wiring with IR Receiver, then you are able to use the remote do manythings you desire.
